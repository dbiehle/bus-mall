## User Stories

### Marketing Research Team
- As a quantitative researcher, I want to see an app that shows a few images at a time to a focus group participant and asks for preference, so I can determine which products to show in our catalogs.
- As a researcher, I want to know whether we any of our products in BusMall resonate with passengers, so I can decide whether we need a new catalog of items.
- As a someone who can only act on verifiable data, I want to know the level of interest each of our current catalog items holds, so I can write up a report for the marketing team showing what works and what doesn't and use data to back up the findings.
- As someone with no programming experience/expertise, I want someone else to build this app that shows me the results in an easy-to-read chart, so I don't have to hunt for the results or go ask that smelly developer to get them for me.

### Developer
- As a developer, I want to create an app for the client that meets all of the needs of the research team, so I could get hired again.
- As a developer, I want my code to display 3 different images at a time to a focus group participant, in a random order for a total of 25 rounds, so the viewer has a simple, quick study to complete.
- As a developer, I want my code to store clicks on images and add up the results to show number of clicks per image, # of times shown, % of time chosen when shown, and % of times chosen overall, so the market research team has usable data.
- As a developer, I want my code to refresh after a click to show 3 new non-duplicated images that weren't shown in the previous round, so I can get preferences that don't skew toward a particular image.

### Focus Group Participant
- As a focus group participant, I want to get paid to tell people what most people would like best, so the world can recognize my brilliance and I can buy a pizza!
- As a person with less-than-perfect vision, I want the display to be easy enough to see, so I don't have to fake my answers.
- As a person who needs to catch a bus, I want the survey to be quick and easy to use so I can catch that bus.
- As a person who loves games, I want the survey to be fun to take so I can have a good time taking this survey.
